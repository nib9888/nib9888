Hi! I'm a python coder predominantly, but I want to learn Rust and/or C.

I'm a fan of [s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6), Shostakovich and [good code](https://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/djblegacy.html).

Static websites are fun (no js, just css), and dynamic websites are on my todo list!

Certain software can also be [considered harmful](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/) :)

Feel free to take a look around my very few repos!
