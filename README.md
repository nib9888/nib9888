Hi! I'm a python coder predominantly, but I want to learn Rust (static typing is op).

I'm a fan of [s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6), Shostakovich, open source AI projects, and [good code](https://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/djblegacy.html).

I hope the first AGI has its weights on huggingface and not an internal corporate server.

Feel free to take a look around my very few repos!
