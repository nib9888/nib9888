Hi! I'm nib9888

I'm a python coder who uses gentoo linux as a daily driver, with s6 as an init system
I love code done 'The Right Way' (See s6 and suckless)
I think that rust is amazing, and really want to learn it
Plus, the fish shell is very friendly and interactive so I like it

I dislike:
 - systemd
 - Pulseaudio
 - Xorg
 - GNOME
 - Proprietary stuff
 - Hard dependencies
 - DRM
 - JS
 - C++
 
 I like:
  - s6
  - Portage
  - Execline
  - Wayland
  - ipfs
  - rust
  - Good code
  - xkcd
  - s6
