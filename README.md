Hi! I'm a python coder predominantly, but I want to learn Rust and/or C.

I'm a fan of [s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6), Shostakovich, Ludovico Einaudi, and [good code](https://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/djblegacy.html).

Static websites are fun (no js, just css), and js as a replacement of CSS3 is causing issues for the modern web...

Feel free to take a look around my very few repos!
